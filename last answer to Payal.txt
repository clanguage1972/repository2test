You are trying to portray yourself as a victim but in reality my mother and I are the real victims and you have tortured us for so long. For the past 10 years, if we do not speak about the earlier period,  you have separated yourself from me and slept in a separate bedroom . Only relation was when if you needed to speak about anything or to give food or if you had to go out then or for buying anything. But past month, all that has stopped too. You left without my permission and proper discussion about your plans, We have not talked at all , no phone contact , no details of the place you have gone to. If I did not answer once or asked you to stay away , you kept away and kept going for 25 days or more a month to a place, I did not know about . Where have you been ? What all you have done ? What all company is your new company ? How can you be trusted now ? 
 
You have instigated my elder daughter against me and my mother and driven her away from me and you're now grooming my younger daughter to turn against me. Why did you do this to me ?

You left me more than 50 days ago without even informing me about your exact plans or exact  details of your work plans. Aashnaa supported it and was party to it . Until 2 days back, you had not even informed me where you had gone till I asked for your address . You did not contact me even once or stopped talking and had no relation at all but you were in constant touch with your father-in-law speaking with him once or twice a day also. First you take his or he gifts a phone which is connected to his bank account without my permission. We had a phone which we could have used commonly and the children could have used it. Why did you take his phone when I did not want it ?. You asked him to shift to your place in Gurgaon or somewhere around from Bhiwani. He has lived in Bhiwani for the past 55 years or more. In Bhiwani, You had a problem even if he came to the kitchen when you were there. You also provoked Aashnaa and Aalishaa on the same point. All this in Bhiwani at home was portray a different scenario to mislead me. 

You knew that when SCO 4 in Huda was sold 17 years back. Aashnaa was very small then or around 5 years old , I had given all my money to him when he asked for it because you kept running from home even then. I thought that the money will be safe with him in his safe custody. At that time, He took all of your mother in law's money as well. But later , He did not return my money and your mother-in-law's money and became the only rich person in the house influencing Aashnaa as if he was doing everything. He pretended that he is taking care of Aashnaa and that he has the means and it was his money. His pension then was 10,000 Ruppes in 2010, 19,000 Rupees in 2020.  When you married me , your family was in debt and had nothing. You married me on my asking as I was from a wealthy family. This is how I look at it now. Next step you took was to go away taking Aashnaa's support when she started earning more than a lakh. Till then, You kept quiet. After that you started focussing on your father-in-law as he has all the money and I do not have any money or business and I did not want to work as you created so much tension in household that my work of coding, I could complete or could concentrate on. I had told you this also that you need to make atmosphere better for me to work. Did you tell Aashnaa this ? How many times I told you this ? My mother took care of all my family financial needs which including needs of yours and children. Your father in law also supported but he had taken all my money and he mainly focussed on Aashnaa so that there could be gradual distancing in Aashnaa's eyes, Aashnaa kept thinking that Dada ji is doing it all but it was my money , grand mother's money in his bank account along with Aashnaa's grandmother's pension that was supporting Aashnaa and other things  . All decisions and financial decisions were being done by Aashnaa's Dadaji as he had systematically taken Dadi Mama's pension under his  hood as well. No money was returned to me or Aashnaa's grandmother. He recently said that I have all accounts for it. I do not need accounts. That money was not to be invested or used . It was given on purpose in good faith and he should return that with interest now. But that was my side . You decided to dump me and only kept in touch with your father-in-law by taking his phone , his sim and got connected to his bank account which had regular money . Whether you used it or not is another thing and does not bother me. Why did you take this freedom when I and your mother-in-law did not want you to do this . 
Next you brain washed my daughter Aashnaa against me as  you did not live with me ever for past 10 years or more and we had no real or meaningful relation in any way. I endured all this for my children. You went away with my daughter Aashnaa when she started earning. She thinks that I am wrong and did not care for her or stayed away from her. But, I had and have nothing against her. She is my child. But , She has so many reasons of her own making, grudges and resentments . It looks like that she does not know me at all after 20 years in the same house. But , One day, She will understand as she will age more and I am going to make her understand my side now . I want to expose you here . As Aashnaa my daughter  was earning a lot of money, You decided to get rid of me and created new reasons . Till the day , She was to leave , You did not have any problem or did not show any signs of what you had in mind like a criminal or professional cheat. You started typing things against me so that can be of use legally later. I understood your language as you were being fed by someone. That will be out soon with all your phone call details and your bank account details along with Aashnaa's. I kept quiet then as I did not want you to leave and wanted to be soft . But now after 50 days as you have done more. You asked my father to come to your place or around and to shift there permanently . You asked him to sell the house here. I have recording evidence of it and I can send it to you and can show it you. Did you think that I am a fool and it will be all a cake walk for you and you will do whatever with me. You are sadly mistaken . Your father-in-law knows about it. . You wanted your father in law to  come to your place permanently where ever you were in and that you can take an extra room for him. You tried the same stunt with your mother in law. As father in law has all my money and your mother in law's money and my money. It suited you that he shift and come to your place so that in future you have more money. You tried to orphan me there and make me alone with no one around. I have seen through all this now and your money oriented and plans against me. You ask your father in law to come around you with all the money where as in Bhiwani you used to pretend , Why does he come near you or in kitchen. You provoked the children Aashnaa and Aalishaa with the same thoughts that whenever you are in kitchen or anywhere the father in law comes in , But now you want your father in law to shift to your place with all the money. Very material person, you , and very full of yourself.

You left me when I was at a low point in my life and needed you the most. My elder daughter thinks that I have not taken care of you and only you are to blame. I do not wish to live with you and am proceeding with divorce. Advocate Saini will send you divorce petition decree in the next 2 to 3 days. Most of the formalities have been completed. This is my last message to you . Next , I shall communicate with you only through court. I shall not come under any pressure and shall not accept any of your conditions. I do not agree with you. I refuse to play ball with you and you will not be able to control me now.. 
But during the marriage, you have spent money that I had got from your mother in law as it was common money between us as to whatever I had. I did not hide any fact from you. For years, I was wearing two clothes or torn clothes. My bank balance is zero Rupees and my monthly earning for the past few years is zero due to the tension you created in family and my mind . Every 2nd day you had an issue. On each of these, you did not speak or spoke to a point as per requirement. Is this your adjustment where you finish me ? But , I am not weak and shall not commit suicide like your father whom you people also did not understand emotionally and mentally. You have tormented me and my mother for the past years of our marriage. You stayed with me till green pastures were there and more independence was there. You broke my home/marriage/ trust and you tried to do the same with your mother-in-law by first keeping bad relation with her and then by trying to break her home by taking her husband away. I have told you before also that I have recording of what you and Aashnaa tried to do with your father in law when you asked him to shift to your place permanently. You have tried to break the family by trying to take away the father in law with you. What relation do you have with him when you do not have any relation with your husband ? Why do you and did you  accept gifts from him when I have reasons of disputes with him and you were in the know how through out and I did not want you to take gifts ? Was he your husband that you only did all in his favour and against me? Why did you support him, use him against me and accepted gifts from him without my permission  and I had refused or when your mother in law had no knowledge about what was going on between you and your father in law and I did not want you to accept gifts from him like the phone and the bank account access.  You have used and tormented me. But it will stop now as we do not have any relation or never had any. Don't contact me directly now. We shall move and speak through legal means only now. You will go to this extent . I never expected this . I feel ashamed that I never understood you and that the person, I married for love , will do everything to destroy me when I am penniless and deceive me . It was a perfect crime for me.
